# 🚀 Mini-Projects: Technical Sandbox
**A Collection of Rapid Prototypes & Experimental Implementations**

## 📌 Overview
This repository is a central hub for my smaller-scale technical explorations. It serves as a testing ground for new libraries, data processing techniques, and automation workflows. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates a specific application of Python and Data Science.

## 🧪 Structural Standards
To maintain clarity, every project within this collection follows a standardized structure:
1. **Source Code:** Well-documented `.py` or `.ipynb` files.
2. **Data:** A `data/` folder containing sample datasets (or links to sources).
3. **Outputs:** An `images/` or `results/` folder showcasing the project's success.
